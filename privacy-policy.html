        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>Data You Enter Into Tools</h3>
        <p>All data you enter into our tools (text, numbers, images, files) is processed entirely within your web
            browser using client-side JavaScript. This data is never transmitted to our servers, stored in any database,
            or shared with any third party. When you close or refresh the page, all data is discarded.</p>

        <h3>Analytics and Cookies</h3>
        <p>We may use analytics services (such as Google Analytics) to understand how visitors use our website. These
            services may collect anonymized data such as page views, device type, browser type, and approximate
            location. This data is used solely to improve our website and is not linked to any personally identifiable
            information.</p>

        <h3>Advertising</h3>

        <h3>localStorage</h3>
        <p>We use browser localStorage to save your theme preference (light or dark mode). This data is stored locally
            on your device and is never transmitted to our servers.</p>
