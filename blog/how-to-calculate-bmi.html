        <h2>What Is Body Mass Index (BMI)?</h2>
        <p>Body Mass Index, commonly known as BMI, is a numerical value derived from a person's weight and height. It
            was first introduced by Belgian mathematician Adolphe Quetelet in the 1830s as a way to define the "average
            man" in statistical terms. Today, BMI is used worldwide by healthcare professionals, insurance companies,
            and public health organizations as a quick screening tool to categorize individuals into weight-status
            categories.</p>
        <p>While BMI is not a direct measure of body fat, it correlates reasonably well with more accurate body fat
            measurements for the majority of the population. It is widely used because it is simple, inexpensive, and
            non-invasive — all you need is a scale and a measuring tape.</p>

        <h2>The BMI Formula</h2>
        <p>BMI can be calculated using either metric or imperial units. Both formulas yield the same result.</p>
        <h3>Metric Formula</h3>
        <p><strong>BMI = weight (kg) ÷ height (m)²</strong></p>
        <p>For example, if you weigh 70 kilograms and are 1.75 meters tall: BMI = 70 ÷ (1.75 × 1.75) = 70 ÷ 3.0625 =
            22.86. This places you in the "normal weight" category.</p>
        <h3>Imperial Formula</h3>
        <p><strong>BMI = (weight (lbs) × 703) ÷ height (inches)²</strong></p>
        <p>For example, if you weigh 154 pounds and are 69 inches tall: BMI = (154 × 703) ÷ (69 × 69) = 108,262 ÷ 4,761
            = 22.74. The constant 703 is a conversion factor that accounts for the difference between metric and
            imperial units.</p>

        <h2>BMI Categories</h2>
        <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) defines the following BMI categories for adults aged 20 and older:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Underweight:</strong> BMI below 18.5 — May indicate malnutrition, eating disorders, or other
                health conditions</li>
            <li><strong>Normal weight:</strong> BMI 18.5 to 24.9 — Generally associated with the lowest health risks
            </li>
            <li><strong>Overweight:</strong> BMI 25.0 to 29.9 — Increased risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes
            </li>
            <li><strong>Obese Class I:</strong> BMI 30.0 to 34.9 — Moderate health risks</li>
            <li><strong>Obese Class II:</strong> BMI 35.0 to 39.9 — Severe health risks</li>
            <li><strong>Obese Class III:</strong> BMI 40.0 and above — Very severe health risks</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step-by-Step: How to Calculate Your BMI</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Measure your weight in kilograms (or pounds)</li>
            <li>Measure your height in meters (or inches). Note: if measuring in centimeters, divide by 100 to convert
                to meters</li>
            <li>Square your height (multiply it by itself)</li>
            <li>Divide your weight by your squared height</li>
            <li>The result is your BMI</li>
        </ol>

            results with automatic unit conversion.</p>

        <h2>Limitations of BMI</h2>
        <p>While BMI is a useful screening tool, it has several well-documented limitations that are important to
            understand:</p>
        <p><strong>Muscle vs. Fat:</strong> BMI does not distinguish between muscle mass and fat mass. Athletes and
            individuals with high muscle mass may have a BMI in the "overweight" or even "obese" range despite having
            low body fat. For example, a bodybuilder weighing 100 kg at 1.80 m would have a BMI of 30.9 (classified as
            obese) despite potentially having a body fat percentage below 15%.</p>
        <p><strong>Age and Gender:</strong> The standard BMI categories do not account for differences in body
            composition related to age and gender. Women naturally carry more body fat than men, and body composition
            changes as we age, with older adults tending to have more fat and less muscle. Despite these variations, the
            same BMI thresholds are applied to all adults.</p>
        <p><strong>Ethnic Variations:</strong> Research has shown that BMI thresholds may not be equally applicable
            across all ethnicities. Asian populations, for instance, tend to have higher health risks at lower BMI
            levels. The WHO has suggested lower BMI cut-offs for Asian populations: overweight at 23.0 and obese at
            27.5.</p>
        <p><strong>Fat Distribution:</strong> BMI does not indicate where fat is stored in the body. Visceral fat (fat
            around internal organs) is more dangerous than subcutaneous fat (fat under the skin). Two individuals with
            identical BMIs may have very different health risk profiles depending on their fat distribution patterns.
            Waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio are better indicators of visceral fat.</p>

        <h2>Better Alternatives to BMI</h2>
        <p>For a more comprehensive health assessment, consider supplementing BMI with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Waist circumference:</strong> Risk increases at &gt;94 cm for men and &gt;80 cm for women</li>
            <li><strong>Body fat percentage:</strong> Measured via DEXA scan, bioelectrical impedance, or skinfold
                calipers</li>
            <li><strong>Waist-to-hip ratio:</strong> Helps assess fat distribution</li>
            <li><strong>Blood work:</strong> Cholesterol, blood sugar, and inflammatory markers provide objective health
                data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>BMI remains a valuable starting point for assessing weight status due to its simplicity and accessibility.
            However, it should never be the sole indicator used to make health decisions. If you have concerns about
            your weight or health, consult a healthcare professional who can evaluate your individual circumstances
            using multiple metrics. For a quick assessment, try our <a href="../tools/bmi-calculator.html">BMI
