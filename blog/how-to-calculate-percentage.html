        <h2>What Is a Percentage?</h2>
        <p>A percentage is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. The word itself comes from the Latin "per
            centum," meaning "by the hundred." When we say 25%, we mean 25 out of 100, or the fraction 25/100, or the
            decimal 0.25. Percentages are everywhere in daily life — from shopping discounts and tax rates to exam
            scores, statistical data, and financial figures.</p>
        <p>Understanding percentages is a fundamental life skill. Whether you are calculating how much you save on a
            sale, figuring out a tip at a restaurant, determining your grade on a test, or analyzing year-over-year
            business growth, percentage calculations come up constantly.</p>

        <h2>Three Essential Percentage Calculations</h2>

        <h3>1. What Is X% of Y? (Finding a Percentage of a Number)</h3>
        <p>This is the most common percentage calculation. The formula is:</p>
        <p><strong>Result = (X / 100) × Y</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> What is 20% of 150? → (20/100) × 150 = 0.20 × 150 = <strong>30</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A jacket costs $85 and is on sale for 30% off. How much is the discount? →
            (30/100) × 85 = <strong>$25.50</strong>. The sale price is $85 - $25.50 = <strong>$59.50</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Mental Math Trick:</strong> To find 10% of any number, simply move the decimal point one place to the
            left. 10% of 250 is 25. To find 5%, halve the 10% value. 5% of 250 is 12.50. To find 20%, double the 10%
            value. 20% of 250 is 50. This makes calculating tips and discounts much easier in your head.</p>

        <h3>2. X Is What Percent of Y? (Finding the Percentage)</h3>
        <p>This calculation tells you what fraction one number is of another, expressed as a percentage. The formula is:
        </p>
        <p><strong>Percentage = (X / Y) × 100</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> You scored 42 out of 50 on a test. What is your percentage? → (42/50) × 100 =
            <strong>84%</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> A company had 200 employees last year and 45 were in the marketing department.
            What percentage works in marketing? → (45/200) × 100 = <strong>22.5%</strong></p>
        <p>This is commonly used in grading, surveys, market share analysis, and budgeting.</p>

        <h3>3. Percentage Change (Increase or Decrease)</h3>
        <p>Percentage change measures how much a value has increased or decreased relative to its original value. The
            formula is:</p>
        <p><strong>Change = ((New Value - Old Value) / |Old Value|) × 100</strong></p>
        <p>A positive result means an increase; a negative result means a decrease.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 1 (Increase):</strong> A stock goes from $80 to $100. What is the percentage increase? →
            ((100 - 80) / 80) × 100 = (20/80) × 100 = <strong>25% increase</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Example 2 (Decrease):</strong> A product's price drops from $120 to $96. What is the percentage
            decrease? → ((96 - 120) / 120) × 100 = (-24/120) × 100 = <strong>-20% (a 20% decrease)</strong></p>

        <h2>Common Percentage Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
        <p><strong>Confusing percentage points with percentages:</strong> If an interest rate goes from 5% to 7%, it
            increased by 2 percentage points, but the percentage increase is actually ((7 - 5) / 5) × 100 = 40%. These
            are very different concepts and are frequently confused in news reports and discussions.</p>
        <p><strong>Asymmetry of increase and decrease:</strong> A 50% increase followed by a 50% decrease does not
            return you to the original value. If $100 increases by 50% to $150, then decreases by 50%, you get $75, not
            $100. This is because the decrease is applied to the new, larger value.</p>
        <p><strong>Dividing by the wrong base:</strong> When calculating percentage change, always divide by the
            original (old) value, not the new value. Dividing by the wrong number gives an incorrect result.</p>

        <h2>Percentage Shortcuts for Everyday Use</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>50%</strong> = half the number (divide by 2)</li>
            <li><strong>25%</strong> = quarter the number (divide by 4)</li>
            <li><strong>10%</strong> = move decimal one place left</li>
            <li><strong>1%</strong> = move decimal two places left</li>
            <li><strong>33.3%</strong> = divide by 3</li>
            <li><strong>Tipping 15%:</strong> Find 10%, then add half of that amount</li>
            <li><strong>Tipping 20%:</strong> Find 10% and double it</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Percentage calculations are a fundamental skill that appears in virtually every area of life. By mastering
            the three core formulas — finding a percentage of a number, determining what percentage one number is of
            another, and calculating percentage change — you will be equipped to handle discounts, grades, financial
            analysis, and much more. For quick calculations, bookmark our <a
